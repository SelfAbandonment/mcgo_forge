# Implementation Summary - CS:GO Bomb Defusal Mode

## Overview

This implementation adds a complete CS:GO-style bomb defusal game mode to Minecraft Forge 1.20.1, recreating the core gameplay loop of Counter-Strike's competitive mode.

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Capability-Based Player Data

**Decision**: Use Forge Capabilities to attach game data to players.

**Rationale**:
- Persists automatically with player NBT
- Follows Forge best practices
- Allows clean separation of concerns
- Backwards compatible - doesn't modify player class

**Implementation**:
```java
PlayerGameData data = PlayerCapabilityProvider.getPlayerData(player);
data.setTeam(Team.TERRORIST);
data.setMoney(800);
```

### 2. Singleton Round Manager

**Decision**: Use singleton pattern for RoundManager.

**Rationale**:
- Single source of truth for game state
- Easy access from anywhere in codebase
- Simplified state management
- No need for dependency injection

**Trade-offs**:
- Not ideal for multi-world scenarios (future enhancement)
- Global state requires careful synchronization
- Testing more difficult (can add reset method)

### 3. World Saved Data for Map Config

**Decision**: Use Minecraft's SavedData system for map configuration.

**Rationale**:
- Persists with world save
- Proper Minecraft integration
- Automatic serialization
- Per-world configuration

**Implementation**:
```java
GameMapData data = GameMapData.get(serverLevel);
data.setTSpawn(pos);
data.addBombSite("A", center, radius);
```

### 4. Event-Based Architecture

**Decision**: Use Forge event bus for game logic.

**Rationale**:
- Follows Forge conventions
- Decoupled components
- Easy to extend
- Minimal performance impact

**Events Used**:
- `ServerTickEvent` - Round timer and state transitions
- `LivingDeathEvent` - Player death handling
- `RegisterCommandsEvent` - Command registration
- `AttachCapabilitiesEvent` - Player capability attachment
- `RegisterCapabilitiesEvent` - Capability registration

### 5. Simplified Mechanics (v1)

**Decision**: Implement instant plant/defuse in first version.

**Rationale**:
- Core gameplay loop working quickly
- Can add progress bars later
- Simpler to test and debug
- Maintains backwards compatibility for future enhancements

**Future Enhancements**:
- Add progress bars (3s plant, 10s/5s defuse)
- Add cancel on movement
- Add sound effects
- Add visual effects

## Backwards Compatibility

### What Was NOT Changed

✅ **No modifications to existing Minecraft items**
✅ **No modifications to existing Minecraft blocks**
✅ **No modifications to existing Minecraft entities**
✅ **No modifications to existing game mechanics**
✅ **Config.java retained unchanged** (example config still present)
✅ **Example items/blocks retained** (EXAMPLE_BLOCK, EXAMPLE_ITEM)
✅ **All existing mod functionality preserved**

### What Was Added (Additive Only)

✅ New packages: `gameplay`, `round`, `world`, `items`, `commands`, `events`
✅ New items: `bomb`, `defuse_kit`
✅ New commands: `/mcgo` command tree
✅ New capabilities: `PlayerGameData`
✅ New saved data: `GameMapData`
✅ New event handlers: `GameEventHandler`

### Compatibility Guarantees

1. **World Compatibility**: Existing worlds work unchanged
   - New data stored separately in `mcgo_forge_map_data`
   - No modification of vanilla save data

2. **Item Compatibility**: All existing items still work
   - New items registered separately
   - No conflicts with vanilla or other mod items

3. **Command Compatibility**: No conflicts with existing commands
   - All commands under `/mcgo` namespace
   - Requires op level 2 (doesn't interfere with player commands)

4. **Capability Compatibility**: Safe capability implementation
   - Only attached to players
   - NBT serialization for persistence
   - Proper lifecycle management with LazyOptional

5. **Performance**: Minimal performance impact
   - Single tick event handler
   - Efficient state checks
   - No constant block updates
   - No entity spawning (yet)

## Technical Specifications

### Round Timings

```
Freeze Time:  15 seconds (300 ticks)
Round Time:   1:55 (2300 ticks)
Bomb Timer:   45 seconds (900 ticks)
Post Round:   5 seconds (100 ticks)
```

### Economy Values

```
Starting Money:  $800
Win Bonus:       $3,250
Loss Bonus:      $1,400
Money Cap:       $16,000
```

### Game Flow State Machine

```
WAITING ──start──> FREEZETIME ──timer──> ACTIVE ──win condition──> POST_ROUND ──timer──> FREEZETIME
                       (15s)               (1:55 or 45s)              (5s)
```

### Win Conditions

1. **Team Elimination**: Last player of opposing team dies
2. **Time Expiration**: 1:55 expires without bomb plant → CT wins
3. **Bomb Explosion**: 45s bomb timer expires → T wins
4. **Bomb Defused**: CT player defuses bomb → CT wins

## Code Quality Features

### Error Handling

- Null checks on all server level operations
- Validation of player teams before actions
- Range checks for bomb plant/defuse
- Graceful handling of missing configuration

### Code Organization

- Clear separation of concerns
- Single responsibility principle
- Minimal coupling between components
- Self-documenting code with clear naming

### Maintainability

- Consistent code style
- Constants for all magic numbers
- Comprehensive inline comments
- Package-based organization

## Testing Recommendations

See `TESTING.md` for comprehensive testing guide covering:
- Setup commands
- Team assignment
- Round flow
- Bomb mechanics
- Win conditions
- Economy system
- Edge cases

## Future Enhancement Roadmap

### Phase 2: Enhanced Bomb Mechanics
- [ ] Plant/defuse progress bars
- [ ] Cancel on movement
- [ ] Plant/defuse sound effects
- [ ] Visual bomb entity
- [ ] Defuse kit speed bonus (5s vs 10s)

### Phase 3: Buy System
- [ ] Buy menu GUI
- [ ] Weapon purchases
- [ ] Equipment purchases
- [ ] Buy zone restrictions
- [ ] Buy timer enforcement

### Phase 4: Weapons & Equipment
- [ ] Gun system (AK-47, M4A4, AWP, etc.)
- [ ] Armor system (kevlar, helmet)
- [ ] Grenades (HE, flash, smoke, molotov)
- [ ] Kill rewards
- [ ] Weapon drop/pickup

### Phase 5: Advanced Features
- [ ] Loss bonus streak system
- [ ] Halftime team swap (after round 15)
- [ ] Overtime system (MR3)
- [ ] MVP system
- [ ] Player statistics
- [ ] Scoreboard UI

### Phase 6: Multi-World Support
- [ ] Per-world round managers
- [ ] World-specific configurations
- [ ] Multiple concurrent games

## Known Limitations

1. **Single World**: Currently supports one game per server
2. **Instant Actions**: Plant/defuse are instant (no progress)
3. **No Buy System**: Economy exists but no purchasing yet
4. **Basic Items**: Bomb and defuse kit are simple items
5. **No Visual Bomb**: Bomb is inventory item, not world entity
6. **No Weapon System**: Uses vanilla Minecraft combat
7. **Manual Setup**: Requires admin to configure map

## Migration Path

This implementation is designed to allow gradual enhancement:

1. **v0.1** (Current): Core gameplay loop
2. **v0.2**: Progress bars for plant/defuse
3. **v0.3**: Buy system
4. **v0.4**: Weapon system
5. **v0.5**: Advanced features
6. **v1.0**: Full CS:GO experience

Each version maintains backwards compatibility with previous versions.

## Contribution Guidelines
