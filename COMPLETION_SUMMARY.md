# Implementation Complete - CS:GO Bomb Defusal Mode ✅

## Summary

Successfully implemented a complete CS:GO-style bomb defusal game mode for Minecraft Forge 1.20.1.

## What Was Delivered

### Core Gameplay Systems (100% Complete)

✅ **Team System**
- 3 teams: Terrorist, Counter-Terrorist, Spectator
- Color-coded team identification
- Persistent team assignment via capabilities
- Team-specific spawn points

✅ **Round Management**
- Full state machine: WAITING → FREEZETIME → ACTIVE → POST_ROUND
- Freeze time: 15 seconds (buy phase)
- Round time: 1:55 (or 45s after bomb plant)
- Post-round: 5 seconds (results display)
- Automatic round progression
- Score tracking (T vs CT)

✅ **Bomb Mechanics**
- C4 Explosive item (Terrorists only)
- Plant mechanics with bomb site detection
- 45-second bomb timer after plant
- Defuse Kit item (Counter-Terrorists only)
- Defuse mechanics with range check
- Position tracking for planted bomb

✅ **Win Conditions**
- Team Elimination (all enemies killed)
- Time Expiration (CT wins if no plant)
- Bomb Explosion (T wins after 45s)
- Bomb Defusal (CT wins if defused)

✅ **Economy System**
- Starting money: $800
- Win bonus: $3,250
- Loss bonus: $1,400
- Money cap: $16,000
- Persistent per-round

✅ **Death & Respawn**
- No mid-round respawn
- Automatic spectator mode on death
- Round-end revival at team spawn
- Proper game mode management

✅ **Command System**
- `/mcgo setspawn t|ct` - Configure spawns
- `/mcgo addsite <name> <radius>` - Add bomb sites
- `/mcgo clearsite` - Remove sites
- `/mcgo start` - Start game
- `/mcgo team <players> t|ct|spec` - Assign teams
- `/mcgo money <players> <amount>` - Set money
- All commands require op level 2

## Technical Highlights

### Best Practices Used
- ✅ Forge Capabilities for player data
- ✅ SavedData for world persistence
- ✅ Event Bus for game logic
- ✅ DeferredRegister for item registration
- ✅ Singleton pattern for round manager
- ✅ NBT serialization for persistence
- ✅ Proper resource cleanup
- ✅ Null safety checks
- ✅ Constants for magic numbers
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns

### Design Patterns
- Singleton (RoundManager)
- State Machine (Round states)
- Capability (Player data)
- Observer (Event handlers)
- Command Pattern (GameCommands)
- Data Transfer (NBT serialization)

### Java Features Used
- Java 17 switch expressions
